# object_oriented_design_four_pillars
This repository follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with a strong focus on its four main pillars: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. These concepts are applied to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code, making the project well-structured and easy to extend.
